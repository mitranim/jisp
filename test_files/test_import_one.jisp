;;
Intended for testing transitive imports. This should be directly imported by a
test, and should import `./test_import_two.jisp` which should NOT be directly
imported by a test. After resolving this file to disk (compiling it), the
other file should already be resolved to disk (compiled), and both should be
immediately importable in JS.

[use `jisp:prelude.mjs` jp]

[jp.import `./test_import_two.jisp` dep]

;;
If the export is missing, this should produce an exception and fail the test.
